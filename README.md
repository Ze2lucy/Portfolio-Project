This portfolio is a personal collection of my work as a software development student, showcasing the projects I've built, the skills I'm developing, and my contributions on GitHub. Each project demonstrates a mix of technical ability and problem-solving, from simple web applications to more complex builds. It also reflects my growth as a self-motivated learner who is exploring both technology and law. Whether you're a recruiter, collaborator, or fellow learner, this portfolio is a window into what I can do and how I approach learning and building in the tech space.
